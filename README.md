# CS640: Age and Race Classification based on Twitter Data
The following repositoary is used as part of the Course Artificial Intelligence in Boston University. It is meant to do the following:
- Using Tweets, we classify their users to be one of four races.
- Using Tweets, we classify their users to be either the age of 21 or above it.
- Using profile pictures, we classify their users to be one of four races.

## Getting started.
You can explore the given python notebooks to see data cleaning, model structure, and calculated metrics. Dependencies for each notebook is mentioned in the begging of the project.

The project has the following structure:
- age_prediction_models.ipynb: has some tried models for age prediction using tweets.
- Logistic_Regression_and_Image_Classification.ipynb: Has our final model for age prediction and also pictures based prediction for race.
- race_prediction_logistic_regression.ipynb: has race prediction models using twitter tweets.
- twitter_prediction.Rmd: It has some insights about the data and how we chose our features.

## Insights
We have a computation wise practical model that has exceeded the current scores for both age prediction and race prediction. For more information, check the report.
